## How to run my Jest test scripts ##
> [!NOTE]
> Assuming my project's repository has been cloned to your local and you are using VSCode (which I am currently using)...

*To run all test scripts:*

1. Click the "Terminal" tab on VSCode app and then click "New Terminal".

2. Type "npm test" in the terminal and hit "enter" key.

*...and if you want to run a specific test script:*

1. Open the "bank.test.js" file.
2. Navigate that test() function for the test case that you only want to test.
3. Add .only before the parenthesis () or after the test() function.
4. Click the "Terminal" tab on VSCode app and then click "New Terminal".
5. Type "npm test" in the terminal and hit "enter" key.
